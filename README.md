Account Bans: Using unauthorized methods to obtain PSN codes can violate Sonyâ€™s terms of service, potentially resulting in your account being suspended or banned.
How Do Scammers Operate?â€‹
Scam sites offering free PSN codes operate by enticing users with the idea of free money or gaming content. These are some of the tactics they use:

Survey Completion: Many scam sites claim that you need to complete surveys to unlock a code. These surveys may ask for personal information or try to get you to sign up for services you don't need.
Download Malicious Apps: Some websites ask you to download apps or software, which may contain malware or spyware.
Fake Social Media Contests: Fraudulent social media accounts may promise free PSN codes as part of a giveaway but require you to follow links or share posts to "qualify," which ultimately leads to scams.
